It seems I encountered issues accessing the repository and fetching the required files. Here are a few steps you can follow to gather the information needed for your comprehensive report:

README File: Check the file in the root directory of your repository. This file usually contains an overview of the project, including its purpose, how to set it up, and how to use it.README.md

Main Scripts:

Look for main scripts typically named something like , , or . These scripts usually contain the entry points for training and evaluating the model.train.pyevaluate.pymain.py
Open these scripts to understand the main processes like data loading, model creation, training loops, and evaluation metrics.
Configuration Files:

Check for configuration files like , , or similar. These files often contain settings for the model, training parameters, and data processing configurations.config.jsonconfig.yaml
Data Processing Functions:

Look for scripts or functions related to data processing. These might be in files named , , etc. They will handle tasks like reading the IMDB dataset, cleaning the data, and preparing it for training.data_loader.pypreprocess.py
Model Training Functions:

Identify functions or classes responsible for model training. These could include defining the model architecture, compiling the model, and running the training loop.
Evaluation Functions:

Find functions or scripts that evaluate the model's performance. This might involve calculating accuracy, generating confusion matrices, or other metrics.
By reviewing these components, you can form a comprehensive understanding of what the code does.
